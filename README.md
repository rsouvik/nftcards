This is a REACT/node MVC App which is not dockerized as I didnt have enough time. The DB is postgres. Make appropriate credential changes in backend/src/ormconfig.ts

Steps:
1. Do a git clone of the repo
2. There are 2 folders: frontend and backend
3. Follow these steps to build:
   a) cd frontend
   b) npm run build
   c) cd ../backend
   d) tsc
   e) npx ts-node src/index.ts (to start the server)
